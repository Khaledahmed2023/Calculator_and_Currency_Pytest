# Calculator_and_Currency_Pytest

Hey,

I've been learning about testing with Pytest as part of my school curriculum, and I thought I'd try it out with a couple of simple Python appsâ€”a calculator and a currency converter.

The main goal here was to understand how Pytest works and how it can be used to test code effectively.

To run the tests, simply type `pytest` in your terminal after cloning the repository and navigating into it.

Feel free to take a look around and explore. Hopefully, it'll shed some light on Pytest and testing in Python.
